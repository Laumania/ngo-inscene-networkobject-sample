Build with Unity version 2022.3.8f1

Made to support the dialog in https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/issues/1053

This should be a ultra simple sample of how to get InScene NetworkObjects work with Custom SceneManagement in NetCode For GameObjects.
(As of writing 2023-09-01, this is not working sadly why I'm in dialog with Unity about it here https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/issues/1053)
